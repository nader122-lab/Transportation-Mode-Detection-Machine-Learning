# Transportation-Mode-Detection-Machine-Learning
The project aims to develop a machine learning algorithm that can detect the different
modes of transport using sensor data provided by the smartphone user. The
implementation of the machine learning code will measure the smartphones:
Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer sensor values to determine the effect
each of these will have on the precision of the system. Therefore, the effectiveness of
the Decision Tree classifier in differentiating between the data will also be evaluated.
This classifier will be used on a 21-hour Dataset containing Still, Drive, Walk, Run and
Bike data. 

the main file is TransportationModeDetection which splits the task at hand into the steps outlined in the figure below
